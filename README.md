# Dots_And_Boxes
A simple game of Dots and Boxes... Made for my 3330 class.

To even run this project, you'll have to do alot of work download the correct Java version and whatever the front-end library used is.
If you can get it to work, enjoy playing a classic old game that I learned recently about (at the time of programming, not the time when this README was made, obviously)
